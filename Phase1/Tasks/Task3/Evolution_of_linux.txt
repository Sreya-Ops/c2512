Evolution of Linux OS 

1.  -1983 : Richard Stallman,an American computer scientist and software freedom activist starts the GNU Project to create a free UNIX-like operating system.
    -Founder of Free Software Foundation (FSF).
    -His work has had a profound impact on the software world, especially in advocating for the freedom to use, modify, and distribute software.


2.  -1991 : Linus Torvalds a Finnish-American software engineer releases the first Linux kernel as a hobby project.
    -Linux kernel is the core component of the Linux operating system. 
    -It serves as the intermediary between the hardware and the software, managing system resources and enabling 
     communication between the various parts of the computer. 
    -Linux kernel is widely used in products like Android, web servers, smart devices, and supercomputers.

3.  -1992 : Linux adopted the GNU General Public License (GPL), which allowed it to combine GNU's tools with the Linux kernel, 
     creating a fully functional operating system that anyone could use and modify.
    -The combination of the GNU tools and the Linux kernel has made GNU/Linux one of the most popular operating systems, 
     especially in server environments and embedded systems.
    

4.  -Mid-1990s : Linux became popular for servers because it was free and reliable. 
    -Early versions like Slackware and Red Hat helped people get started with it.


5.  -1998 : Big companies like IBM and Oracle started supporting Linux, making it more mainstream. 
    -This boosted the open-source movement, where software is shared freely.


6.  2000s : Desktop environments (GNOME, KDE) and user-friendly distributions (Ubuntu) make Linux accessible to general users.
 

7.  2010s : Linux becomes dominant in cloud computing, mobile (Android), and supercomputing.


8.  2020s : Linux powers critical systems in AI, IoT, and continues as the backbone of enterprise and developer tools.
    
    
Early Foundations`
1. `1969 – Creation of UNIX`  
   - The UNIX operating system was developed at AT&T's Bell Labs by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.  
   - Its modular design and multi-user capabilities inspired many later operating systems, including Linux.

2. `1983 – GNU Project`  
   - Richard Stallman launched the GNU Project to create a free UNIX-like operating system.  
   - The GNU tools (compiler, shell, utilities) would later become integral to Linux distributions.

3. `1987 – MINIX`  
   - Andrew S. Tanenbaum developed MINIX, a UNIX-like operating system for educational purposes.  
   - MINIX inspired Linus Torvalds in developing Linux.

Birth of Linux
4. `1991 – Linus Torvalds Starts Linux`  
   - Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, began working on a kernel for his personal computer.  
   - On `August 25, 1991`, he announced his project in a newsgroup, stating that it was "just a hobby, won’t be big and professional."  
   - The first version, `Linux 0.01`, was released in September 1991.

5. `1992 – Linux Adopts GNU Components`  
   - Linux integrated with GNU tools, forming a complete operating system often referred to as GNU/Linux.  
   - The Free Software Foundation supported its development under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

`Growth and Community Development`
6. `1994 – Linux 1.0`  
   - Linux Kernel 1.0 was officially released with networking capabilities and support for file systems like ext2.  
   - Linux started gaining popularity among developers and hobbyists.

7. `1996 – Linux 2.0`  
   - Introduced support for multiple processors (SMP) and improved networking.  
   - The penguin, `Tux`, was adopted as Linux's mascot.

8. `1998 – Enterprise Adoption Begins`  
   - Major corporations like IBM and Oracle began supporting Linux.  
   - Open-source web servers like Apache gained traction on Linux systems.

9. `2003 – Linux in Supercomputers`  
   - Linux became a dominant OS in the high-performance computing (HPC) world,powering the majority of supercomputers.

`Modernization and Popularity`
10. `2004 – Ubuntu Launch`  
    - Canonical released Ubuntu, a user-friendly Linux distribution, significantly increasing Linux adoption among non-technical users.

11. `2011 – Android Dominates Mobile`  
    - Google’s Android, built on a modified Linux kernel,became the most popular mobile operating system globally.

12. `2013 – Linux Powers the Cloud`  
    - Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud embraced Linux due to its flexibility, scalability, and open-source nature.

13. `2015 – Linux Kernel 4.0`  
    - Major improvements in system performance, security, and support for modern hardware.

14. `2020s – Linux Everywhere`  
    - Linux continues to dominate in servers, IoT, embedded systems, and desktops for enthusiasts.  
    - It is the backbone of modern technologies like `Kubernetes`, `Docker`, and `AI/ML platforms`.

`Current Status`
- Linux is a critical component of global IT infrastructure, powering:
  - Over 90% of the world’s supercomputers.
  - Most web servers and cloud environments.
  - A significant portion of desktops, especially among developers.
